# Django Authentication Program
aaa
## Introduction

This is a simple authentication program built using Django, HTML, and CSS. The purpose of this program is to provide user authentication functionality, allowing users to register, log in, and log out of the application. The program uses Django's built-in authentication system and provides a user-friendly interface with HTML and CSS.

## Features

1. User Registration: New users can register by providing their username, email, and password.

2. User Login: Registered users can log in using their credentials.

3. User Logout: Logged-in users can log out from the application.

4. Password Reset: Users can request a password reset if they forget their password.

## Installation

Follow the steps below to set up and run the authentication program locally on your machine:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kikulwe/authenticate.git
   cd authentication-program
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS and Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up the database by running migrations:

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. Create a superuser (admin) account:

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

6. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

7. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to access the authentication program.

## Usage

1. Home Page: The home page displays a welcome message and provides options for login and registration.

2. Registration: Click on the "Register" link on the home page to access the registration page. Provide a unique username, a valid email address, and a strong password to register.

3. Login: Click on the "Login" link on the home page to access the login page. Enter your registered username and password to log in.

4. Logout: After logging in, you can log out by clicking the "Logout" link, which will redirect you back to the home page.

5. Password Reset: If you forget your password, click on the "Forgot Password?" link on the login page. You will receive an email with instructions to reset your password.

## Customization

You can customize the look and feel of the application by modifying the HTML and CSS files located in the relevant directories. Additionally, you can extend the functionality by adding new views and templates as needed.
